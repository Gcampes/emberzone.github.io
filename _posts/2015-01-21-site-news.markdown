Greetings, Ember fiends!

The Ember Zone is not a cold, dead place. I've been busy with client work and also less inclined to post because Wordpress is such a drag. So I converted all of the content to Markdown and started a Jekyll blog using Github Pages for hosting. As a result, the content is now Open Source, licensed under the MIT license. So if you see anything that you think doesn't make sense, feel free to <a href='https://github.com/emberzone/emberzone.github.io'>open a PR!</a> I also took the opportunity to cook up a new design which hopefully focuses more on the content.

I've also been waiting and watching Ember-CLI, which is looking ever more mature to the point where I don't feel that I could spend time writing something only for it to be invalidated soon after with a major change.

As always I'm open to hearing what you want me to write about. My latest thoughts are an introductory series on Broccoli, because the documentation is pretty hellish and/or paper thin. If you have any ideas, please leave a comment below!
